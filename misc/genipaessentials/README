Given a satisfiable formula F and a variable x, we say that x is
essential for the satisfiability of F if a truth value (True or False)
must be assigned to x in each satisfying assignment of F. This application
finds all the variables essential for the satisfiability of a given formula.

The algorithm tests each variable one by one on the dual-rail encoded
formula. Each test is done using two assumptions which represent the
constraint that the given variable must not be assigned.

The same application is implemented in Java (in the APPJAVA folder) to
demonstrate the usage of an IPASIR solver in a Java application.
